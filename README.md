# CRUD-Application-using-Node.js
I have created this project under assignment task. It's basically a CRUD application in Node.js using express. This program is actually product management system in which Signup and Login system is also available. Roles as Buyer or Seller is assigned to every new person Signing up. Then according to role different views with different options are shown to them and much more, read README file

Greetings everyone!

This project is very basic implementation of Node.js to make product management system.
Express is used with handlebars, html is also used

To set this working on your system 
follow along...

First download the zip folder and unzip it.
There will be 2 folders named as 'CRUD' and 'new sql files'. 
We will talk about 'CRUD' folder later, now let me explain 'new sql files'

'new sql files' contains two .sql files that you have to import in database.
I used XAMPP to access sql database.
Create 2 databases in database manager ... one database with the name "crud_db" and other with the name "nodelogin".
Now import 'crud_db.sql' inside 'crud_db' database and
import 'nodelogin.sql' inside 'nodelogin' databse.
You are done with setting up database.

Now come to 'CRUD' folder. This folder contains all the required files and folder to run this program succesfully. They are structured in required manner.
Make sure to put 'CRUD' folder on desktop or otherwse change the code accordingly. 
Load this whole folder in any source code editors like VS Code.
'index.js' is the main file you have to run using `node` command in terminal(or whatever way you like)

Things you have to change according to your system 
--------------------------------------------------
I have used absolute paths in the 'index.js' file to deal with images.
You have to set that path according to you system 
For example:
I have used this absolute path: "C:/Users/Muhammad Abdullah/Desktop/CRUD/views/images/"  in line # 185 in 'index.js'.
you have to change it according to your correct absolute path to 'images' folder.

Thank You
